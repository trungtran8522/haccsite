        <h3>Vaccine types</h3>
        <h5>Messenger RNA (mRNA)</h5>
        <p>Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine. This type of vaccine uses genetically engineered mRNA to give your cells instructions for how to make a harmless piece of the S protein found on the surface of the COVID-19 virus. After vaccination, your immune cells begin making the S protein pieces and displaying them on cell surfaces. This causes your body to create antibodies. If you become infected with the COVID-19 virus, these antibodies will fight the virus.</p>
        <h5>Vector Vaccine</h5>
        <p>Vector vaccine. In this type of vaccine, genetic material from the COVID-19 virus is inserted into a different kind of weakened live virus, such as an adenovirus. The weakened virus (viral vector) serves as a delivery system. When the viral vector gets into your cells, it delivers genetic material from the COVID-19 virus that gives your cells instructions to make copies of the S protein. Once your cells display the S proteins on their surfaces, your immune system responds by creating antibodies and defensive white blood cells. If you become infected with the COVID-19 virus, the antibodies will fight the virus.</p>
        <h5>Protein Subunit</h5>
        <p>Protein subunit vaccine. Subunit vaccines include only the parts of a virus that best stimulate your immune system. This type of COVID-19 vaccine contains harmless S proteins. Once your immune system recognizes the S proteins, it creates antibodies and defensive white blood cells. If you become infected with the COVID-19 virus, the antibodies will fight the virus.</p>

        <h3>Facts</h3>
        <h5>Can a COVID-19 vaccine make me sick with COVID-19?</h5>
        <p>No. None of the authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines or COVID-19 vaccines currently in development in the United States contain the live virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
        <h5>After getting a COVID-19 vaccine, will I test positive for COVID-19 on a viral test?</h5>
        <p>No. Neither the recently authorized and recommended vaccines nor the other COVID-19 vaccines currently in clinical trials in the United States can cause you to test positive on viral tests.</p>
        <h5>Will a COVID-19 vaccination protect me from getting sick with COVID-19?</h5>
        <p>Yes. COVID-19 vaccination works by teaching your immune system how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19, and this protects you from getting sick with COVID-19.</p>
        <h5>Will a COVID-19 vaccine alter my DNA?</h5>
        <p>No. COVID-19 vaccines do not change or interact with your DNA in any way.</p>
