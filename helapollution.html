        <h2><b>The current problems</b></h2>
        <p style="margin-right:20%">Air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year. WHO data shows that 9 out of 10 people breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits containing high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures.</p>
        <p style="margin-right:20%">From smog hanging over cities to smoke inside the home, air pollution poses a major threat to health and climate. The combined effects of ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution cause about seven million premature deaths every year, largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections.</p>
        <p style="margin-right:20%">Around 91% of the worldâ€™s population lives in places where air quality levels exceed WHO limits. While ambient air pollution affects developed and developing countries alike, low- and middle-income countries experience the highest-burden, with the greatest toll in the WHO Western Pacific and South-East Asia regions. </p>
        <p style="margin-right:20%">Sources of air pollution are multiple and context-specific. The major outdoor pollution sources include residential energy for cooking and heating, vehicles, power generation,   agriculture/waste incineration, and industry. Policies and investments supporting integrated policies that support sustainable land use, cleaner household energy and transport, energy-efficient housing, power generation, industry, and better municipal waste management can effectively reduce key sources of ambient air pollution. </p>
        <p style="margin-right:20%">If we, as a human civilization, continue onwards without the fix to this current problem, it can carry massive impact and consequences to our future. For a specific example, if the Earth was polluted so bad during Mark Watney's trip to the Mars, the impact would be apparent as potato plants would not be able to sprout due to the possible chance of the potatoes getting poisoned by the air!</p>

        <h2><b>Saving our planet</b></h2>
        <p style="margin-right:20%">It does not take much to start on your own unlike popular beliefs. "Greening" your business doesn't require lowering overall material production, but it does require you to use energy and resources more efficiently, and mitigate existing waste streams. The following tips can help your business attract this growing audience of green consumers and employees: </p>
        <h4><b>Leave the Car at Home</b></h4>
        <p style="margin-right:50%">As a business owner looking for a new location, consider sites that have convenient access to bike lanes and transit, and encourage employees to walk, cycle, or carpool to work.</p>
        <h4><b>Reduce Water Usage</b></h4>
        <p style="margin-right:50%">Whether your business is located in a drought-stricken area or not, reducing water use is one obvious way to save money and help conserve valuable environmental resources.<br> Ways you can reduce water usage on your business premises include: </p>
        <ul style="margin-right: 60%">
            <li>Fixing dripping taps, plumbing leaks, and installing low-flow toilets and faucet aerators in your washrooms.</li>
            <li>Moving to a drought-tolerant landscape design, with drip irrigation and rain sensors where necessary.</li>
            <li>Using a high-efficiency pressure washer for cleaning jobs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><b>Recycle Electronics</b></h4>
        <p style="margin-right: 50%">Keeping your surplus electronic equipment out of the landfill is a great way to help the environment and benefit those in need. Electronic waste (e-waste) is the fastest-growing waste stream in the world, with an estimated 48.5 million tons produced in 2018.<br>If your business is replacing electronic items such as computers, monitors, tablets, smartphones, or printers, chances are they can be put to good use by schools or charities in your area.<br>Make sure you remove all sensitive information from any devices before you recycle them.  </p>
